        Here is the sob story of my life. A trajicomical tale about how doing
        your best isn&apos;t really worth anything and how Beaudelaire was right
        when he hammered on about the importance of being drunk as often as you
        can. I know hw was more about the drunkeness of the things that make you
        happy, but I am fairly sure he mentions wine or something at some point.
        It has been some time since I read that poem last as I no longer feel
        the need for a pretentious justification of my alcohol dependency
