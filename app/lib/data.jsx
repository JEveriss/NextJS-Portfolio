        After a decade long career in retail working for various brands and
        progressing to the position of Store Manager, I was made redundant as a
        result of the Coronavirus pandemic. Twice. Although deeply upsetting,
        this gave me the opportunity to rethink some decisions and consider my
        career choices.
        <span style={{display: "block", height: 16}}/>
        I had always been interested in Web Development and had made a number of
        very rudimentary websites. I had completed several online tutorials, but
        the bootcamps, which could take my knowledge to the next level, were all
        prohibitively expensive and exclusionary. Until I found the School Of
        Code.
        <span style={{display: "block", height: 16}}/>
        School of Code, the 16 week full-stack intensive bootcamp allowed me to
        retrain as a Web Developer, but also aided with getting employment. I
        was successful in my application to the 383 Project as an Associate
        Frontend Engineer, where I worked on several project during my time
        there.
